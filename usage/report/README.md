## Instructions for Creating Reports

Before executing Hurl to run tests and create reports, you need to create output folders:
```bash
./create-report-folders.sh
```

Once the output folder is ready, you can run the tests and generate reports in different formats:

### HTML Report
```bash
./create-html-report.sh
```

### JSON Report
```bash
./create-json-report.sh
```
